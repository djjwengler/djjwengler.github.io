      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- Steps 4-8 -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/484d5b-2d3039-c0ccd4-e6c229-931f1d"
        target="_blank"
        >https://coolors.co/484d5b-2d3039-c0ccd4-e6c229-931f1d</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary 1</th>
          <th>Secondary 2</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">#484d5b</td>
          <td class="secondary1">#2d3039</td>
          <td class="secondary2">#c0ccd4</td>
          <td class="accent1">#e6c229</td>
          <td class="accent2">#931f1d</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- Step 9 -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Oswald
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font is a contemporary san-serif that helps the website maintain a
        modern feel. Used primarily for headings and navigation.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Cardo
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The serif font creates a nice contrast to the san-serif headline. This
        font is used for normal text found in paragraphs, lists, and forms.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        The Yardley Chamber of Commerce serves its community by promoting local
        businesses.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        The Yardley Chamber of Commerce serves its community by promoting local
        businesses.
      </p>

      <!-- Step 10 -->

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">City</a></li>
